## FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 304L Stainless Steel?**

A: The primary difference lies in the carbon content. 304 stainless steel has a maximum carbon content of 0.08%, while 304L has a maximum carbon content of 0.03%. This lower carbon content makes 304L more resistant to intergranular corrosion, especially in welded components.
