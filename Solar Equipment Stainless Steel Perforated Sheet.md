## FAQs

**Q1:** What is the difference between #4 brushed and mirror polished finish?  
**A1:** The #4 brushed finish has a linear grain texture, making it more resistant to fingerprints and smudges. The mirror polished finish, on the other hand, provides a smooth, reflective surface.

**Q2:** How do I choose the right hole size and pattern for my application?  
**A2:** The choice depends on your specific needs. Smaller holes are better for filtration purposes, while larger holes may be preferred for ventilation and aesthetics.

**Q3:** What is the maximum thickness available for these sheets?  
**A3:** We offer sheets with a thickness ranging from 0.5mm to 3.0mm, catering to various application requirements.
