## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 316 stainless steel?**
A: 304 is the most common grade, offering good corrosion resistance and formability. 316 has added molybdenum, making it more resistant to chemicals and chlorides.

**Q: How do I choose the right thickness?**
A: The choice depends on the application. For light-duty uses like kitchen appliances, thinner sheets (0.5mm) are suitable. For heavy-duty applications, thicker sheets (2.0mm) are recommended.

**Q: Can you provide custom sizes?**
A: Yes, we offer custom cutting services to meet your specific requirements. Please contact us with your specifications.
