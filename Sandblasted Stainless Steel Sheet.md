## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: What is the difference between sandblasting and regular stainless steel?**

**Q: How do I maintain the sandblasted finish?**
A: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is sufficient. Avoid abrasive cleaners or tools that can scratch the surface.

**Q: Can you provide custom sizes?**
A: Yes, we offer custom cutting services to meet your specific needs. Please contact us at +65 83016969 for more details.
